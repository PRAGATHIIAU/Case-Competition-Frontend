# ✅ Folder Structure Fixed

## Current Structure
```
C:\Users\darsh\Downloads\Case-competition_frontend\
├── backend\          ✅ (All backend files - 253 files merged)
└── frontend\         ✅ (All frontend files)
```

## ✅ What Was Fixed
1. **Removed nested `backend/backend/` folder** - Cleaned up duplicate structure
2. **All 253 files copied** from 5 source folders into single `backend/` folder
3. **Mentor mapping functionality** - Integrated
4. **Alumni CRUD** - Repository and services ready
5. **All routes merged** - Single `routes/index.js` with all endpoints

## 📝 Manual Step Required

**The folder is currently locked by Cursor. To rename it:**

1. **Close Cursor completely**
2. **Open File Explorer**
3. **Navigate to:** `C:\Users\darsh\Downloads\`
4. **Right-click** on `Case-competition_frontend`
5. **Select "Rename"**
6. **Change to:** `Case-competition`
7. **Press Enter**

## Final Structure (After Rename)
```
C:\Users\darsh\Downloads\Case-competition\
├── backend\          ✅ Complete backend with all features
└── frontend\         ✅ Complete frontend
```

## Backend Features Integrated
- ✅ Mentor Mapping (`POST /api/mentors/recommend`)
- ✅ Alumni Repository (`alumni.repository.js`)
- ✅ Admin Features (Admin controller, routes, services)
- ✅ Industry Features (Industry user repository)
- ✅ Student Features (Student CRUD)
- ✅ Events (Event CRUD)
- ✅ Connections (Connection requests)
- ✅ Notifications
- ✅ Search

## Next Steps
1. Rename folder manually (see above)
2. Open Cursor in the renamed folder
3. Run `cd backend && npm install`
4. Run `npm run dev` to start backend
5. Run `cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev` to start frontend
